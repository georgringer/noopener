TYPO3 Extension `noopener`
==========================

This extension adds ``rel="noopener noreferrer"`` to any links which are external
links or defined with target ``'_blank'``. This improves the security of the site:

- **noopener**: Instructs the browser to open the link without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it â€” by not setting the Window.opener property on the opened window (it returns null).
- **noreferrer**: Prevents the browser, when navigating to another page, to send this page address, or any other value, as referrer via the `Referer:` HTTP header.

Installation
------------

1) Get the extension by using composer `composer require georgringer/noopener` 
2) Install the extension.
3) Done

Usage
-----
If it's enough that the extension is adding only the code ``rel="noopener noreferrer"``
to external links, then nothing has to be done after installation, it's done
automatically.

Nevertheless the extension can be used to manipulate the ``rel``-attribute further:

Simple extended usage
---------------------
To switch off that the default values ``noopener noreferrer`` are added to the
``rel``-attribute , use this TypoScript code:  
::
    config.tx_noopener {
      useDefaultRelAttribute = false
    }

with the code ``relAttribute = nofollow`` another ``rel``-value can be added,
assumed the defaut values shall still be removed the code looks then like this:  
::
    config.tx_noopener {
      useDefaultRelAttribute = false
      relAttribute = nofollow
    }

Advanced extended usage
-----------------------
If for some link one or several CSS-classes can be added, then CSS-classes
with the prefix ``rel-`` can be configured being parsed and either copied or 
shifted to the ``rel-``-attribute.  
Assum a link with definitoin for CSS-classes like this:
::
    class="rel-nofollow rel-something col-right kunterbunt"

In combination with the following setup the part ``rel-nofollow`` will be used
by the extension to add the value ``nofollow`` to the ``rel``-attribute:  
::
    config.tx_noopener {
      useCssClass = 1
      keepCssRelClass = 0
    }

Due to the setting ``keepCssRelClass = 0`` will remove the corresponding part
from the CSS-classes, so the final HTML will be clean and never show the
logical relation between the attribute ``class`` and ``rel-`` which exists only
in this extension.  
So the notation of the ``rel`` and ``class``-attributes will look like that:  
::
    rel="nofollow" class="rel-something col-right kunterbunt"

The reason why the css-class ``rel-something`` was not moved to the
``rel-``-attribute is that the value `something` never has any standardized
meaning and therefor is not included in the list of allowed values.  
A list of allowed values can be seen here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types  

All mentioned expressions on that page can be used, everything else will be
ignored and stay in the definition for the class-attribute.  
As ``rel`` is often used for image-galleries this filter might look disadvantageous,
but keep in mind that the extension is only handling external links (or those
with target ``_blank``) and images are usually served locally.  

Also keep in mind that the settings can be various on different pages, as
the settings are defined by ``TypoScript``, so with a bit nifty code settings
could be different even on the same page but in differen cols.

Requirements
------------

- TYPO3 LTS 8.7 or 9.5

*TYPO3 10.1 will add the basic setting* ``rel="noopener noreferrer"`` *for external
links by default!*
